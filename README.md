# 100Devs
These projects are for the 100Devs cohort with Leon Noel. 
They range from simple HTML sites to responsive pages (using both floats and flexbox). 
Some work is recreating websites that already exist from a screenshot.
100Devs is focused on full stack development with JavaScript and includes reading documentation from MDN and Shay Howe.
Not included in this repository is a synopsis of Independence Day and various coffee chats with other developers around the world!
